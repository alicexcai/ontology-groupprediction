# Binary Task Paths Hierarchical Model - Performance Evaluation

## Overview
This document reports the implementation and evaluation of a binary task paths hierarchical model as an alternative task representation for predicting group advantage using ElasticNet regression. The analysis compares performance across multiple task representation approaches.

## Implementation Details

### Model Architecture
- **Data Source**: Binary task paths from `mapping_data/binary_task_paths.csv`
- **Features**: 35 binary hierarchical task features representing task decomposition
- **Controls**: playerCount, Low, Medium, High difficulty levels (4 additional features)
- **Total Base Features**: 39 (35 binary + 4 controls)
- **Feature Expansion**: Polynomial interactions (degree=2) resulting in 780 total features
- **Algorithm**: ElasticNet regression with cross-validation for hyperparameter selection

### Experimental Setup
- **Training/Testing**: Same wave configuration as baseline models
  - Wave 1: Train on Wave 1 tasks → Test on remaining tasks
  - Wave 2: Train on Waves 1-2 tasks → Test on Wave 3 tasks
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Custom R² and RMSE using identical methodology to baseline models
- **Comparison Models**: Task Space (24D), McGrath variants, Steiner, Laughlin subspaces

## Model Characteristics

### Dimensionality Comparison
- **Task Space**: 28 base features → 406 features with interactions
- **Binary Hierarchy**: 39 base features → 780 features with interactions
- **Complexity**: Binary hierarchy uses 92% more features than Task Space

### Performance Patterns
- **Task-Dependent Performance**: Different models excel at different prediction tasks
  - Strong advantage: Task Space performs best
  - Weak advantage: Binary hierarchy performs best
- **Model Complexity**: Higher feature count does not guarantee better performance across all metrics
- **Control Variables**: Adding control variables to binary hierarchy features produces identical results, suggesting regularization eliminates redundant features

## Validation

### Baseline Verification
All baseline model results match published paper values:
- Task Space ElasticNet Strong (Train W1→Test W2): Paper = 0.40, Implementation = 0.398
- Task Space ElasticNet Strong (Train W1-2→Test W3): Paper = 0.43, Implementation = 0.430
- Task Space ElasticNet Weak (Train W1→Test W2): Paper = 0.02, Implementation = 0.021
- Task Space ElasticNet Weak (Train W1-2→Test W3): Paper = 0.40, Implementation = 0.403

### Methodological Consistency
- Identical preprocessing and evaluation procedures across all models
- Same train/test splits and cross-validation methodology
- Consistent feature engineering approach (polynomial interactions)

## Observations

### Performance Variability
- Strong group advantage prediction shows less variability across models (R² range: -0.31 to 0.43)
- Weak group advantage prediction shows high variability (R² range: -0.32 to 0.84)
- No single model dominates across all prediction scenarios

### Task Representation Trade-offs
- **24D Task Space**: Continuous dimensions, theoretically grounded, best for strong advantage
- **Binary Hierarchy**: Process-oriented, interpretable features, best for weak advantage
- **Traditional Taxonomies**: Limited predictive power across both outcome types

### Model Complexity vs Performance
- Higher dimensional models do not consistently outperform lower dimensional ones
- Performance appears more dependent on representation quality than feature quantity
- Regularization in ElasticNet effectively handles high-dimensional feature spaces

## Technical Notes

### Data Coverage
- Successfully integrated binary task paths with 20 out of 21 experimental tasks
- No missing data issues after task name standardization
- Consistent sample sizes across model comparisons

### Statistical Considerations
- R² values represent improvement over complexity-matched baseline predictions
- RMSE values indicate absolute prediction error magnitude
- Results are directly comparable due to identical evaluation methodology

## Summary

The binary task paths hierarchical model demonstrates different predictive strengths compared to existing task representations. While it does not universally outperform the 24D Task Space model, it shows superior performance for predicting weak group advantage scenarios. The results suggest that task representation choice should be guided by the specific prediction objective rather than assuming one approach is universally superior. Multiple representation approaches may capture complementary aspects of group performance dynamics.
